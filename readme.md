## Diet Advent of code 2021

This year the rules are more strict and writing it in rust will not suffice. We have to adhere to following rules:

1. No semicolons
2. No Crates
3. No if
4. no while

## Running

To run day 3 part 2 use the following command:

```
cargo run --bin day_3_part2

```

Remember there is no `_` (underscore) after part in above command so don't do something like day_3_part_2

## Inspiration

One of my favorite mentor museun started writing advent of code 2021 using this approach (like no semicolon etc.). So, I
thought I should also try. After doing one or two puzzle I really like this approach and it makes me think differently.
So I decided to solve puzzle using this approach.
